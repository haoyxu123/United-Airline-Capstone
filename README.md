# United-Airline
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 60,000+ real-time aircraft data points, covering 22 engine-related 
variables across multiple aircraft models. 
• Employed a dynamic sliding window technique to process the dataset and applied an autoencoder model to detect 
potential anomalies in the time series. 
• Analyzed reconstruction error over time, identified significant spikes, and further investigated specific time 
periods to detect potential anomalies in engine performance. Achieved a validation loss of 0.0013, providing 
insights into periods with higher error values. 
• Generated visual comparisons of real vs. predicted data during anomalous periods, highlighting discrepancies and 
flagging potential engine performance issues.
